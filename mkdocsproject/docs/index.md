# Welcome to the documentation website for *My Community Technology Platform*

## Visit [MYCTP](https://myctp.org/).org

## Wait, this site explains the other site?

Yes, exactly. The other site, myctp.org is so amazing that it needs this site to make sure it makes sense.

The complete code for both are held in the same repository. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/grant-king/cyberindex) to see the contribution [commit history](https://github.com/grant-king/cyberindex/commits/main/).

On our GitHub you'll be able to find out the answers to:

* when did it start?
* when was anything last updated??
* what files have been created or updated: how and when???
* who is encouraged to use the source code for any purpose? (hint: it's you)
