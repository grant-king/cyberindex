### Wait, this site explains the other site?!

Yes, exactly. The other site, myctp.org is so amazing it needs this site to make it make sense.

Both are held in the same repository. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/grant-king/cyberindex) to see the contribution [commit history](https://github.com/grant-king/cyberindex/commits/main/). 

On our GitHub you'll be able to find out the answers to: 

* when did it start?
* when was anything last updated??
* what files have been created or updated: how and when???

Let us progress.
