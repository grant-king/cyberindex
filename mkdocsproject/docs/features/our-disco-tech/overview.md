# Our Disco Tech Overview

an experimental voxel builder game

## Core Experience

- **Dual Interface System**
  - View the same data from immersive 3D exploration and intuitive 2D building modes
  - 3D World: Collect voxels while exploring a three-dimensional environment
  - 2D Builder: Place collected voxels in a dynamic grid system that represents slices of the current 3D world
  - Navigate 3D and build in 2D at the same time on multiple screens

## Educational Value & Skills Development
