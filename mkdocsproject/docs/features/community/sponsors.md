# Sponsors

If you feel especially aligned with our community and would like to experience another level of involvment, you may want to consider becoming a sponsor.

# What is a Sponsor account?
Our platform uses alternative methods for temporarily authenticating most users. Sponsor accounts are perpetually persistant accounts that use traditional password authentication. These accounts have the abiilty to buy platform credit packages. Platform credits are 1 cent each and may be traded to use premium features.

# How to get started? Where do sponsors log in? Sponsor login???
Read our About page on the main platform, you'll find the login link after the blurb about Sponsors. There is also a covert link hiding in plain sight in the main site's main navigation sidebar... can you find it?
